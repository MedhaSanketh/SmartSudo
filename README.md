# Data Flow
- Puzzle Generation: Client requests new puzzle â†’ Server generates using backtracking â†’ Returns puzzle and solution
- Gameplay: User interactions update client state â†’ Validation occurs locally â†’ Server validates on completion
- AI Hints: Current puzzle state sent to server â†’ OpenAI API processes puzzle â†’ Strategic hint returned
- Visualization: Server generates step-by-step solving process â†’ Client renders animated visualization
